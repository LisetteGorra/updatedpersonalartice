        <h2 class="topic"><center>Was I always a dragon?</center></h2>
        <p class="details">Maybe deep down on the inside.  I attended a vocational high school where I received a certificate in electronics, which was never used.  After high school I went straight to the corporate world where I managed a group of 30 collectors at a time through-out my 9 year career.  My hobby allowed me to gain a vast experience with sales, marketing, brand management, and writing, obtained whilst pursuing a hobby in the entertainment industry which resulted in several placements.  I&#8217;ve collaborated with brands such s Kevin Hart, Fat Man Scoop, Krayzie Bone (Bone Thugs N Harmony), Code Black, Lions Gate Ent, AND Gloria Govan from MTV&#8217;s BasketBall Wives. I recently realized to be the most successful in entertainment, being your own: manager, writer, producer, and engineer isn&#8217;t enough. You also need to understand how the internet and other technologies can advance your market, your profit, and your products presentation.  As you can see Computer Science is a new, and foreign interest to me.</p>
       
        <h2 class="topic"><center>Why CareerDevs?</center></h2>
        <p class="details">The first time I heard about this Industry was through an old high school friend.  He had graduated 2 years prior with a computer science degree and never used it.  He moved with his wife and children to P.R. for 2 years.  He and his family moved back to MA just before hurricane Maria hit (also his wife's name [Maria]).  With a two year employment gap in his resume and no actual working experience in the field of Computer Science, he was able to land a job making 100k as an entry level employee. That information soaked in my mind for a few months before I began to do more research.  My research and network led to a recommendation down a glorious yellow brick road, where the destination was not Emerald City.  The destination was a school that would inevitably develop my mind set, computational skills, and problem solving abilities.  Now I am proud to say that I am apart of a studious legion dedicated to learning the teachings of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application.  There is no limit to what can be created or even destroyed with the unlimited power of Computer Science at your fingertips.  I am thankful to be in the incubator of my career that is &#8220;CareerDevs&#8221;.  Thank you to the unrelenting behavior of the scholarly Arnelle Millhouse, his faculty (Cliff), and his investors for making this career development a possibility in the ever growing Industry of technology here in Rhode Island.</p>
       
        <h2 class="topic"><center>Tips to getting started and being an efficient CareerDev student</center></h2>
        <p class="details">CareerDevs is a program that offers an uninterrupted learning continuum over a stretch of 12 months or less, that focuses on the scope of Javascript, CSS, HTML web design, mobile app design and other relevant application design.  The only thing you can do to prepare your self to learn the material is to focus more, be an independent student, be present and ask questions.  If given the chance to start the program over, now that I am more cognizant of the challenges, I would not work a regular job.  Instead, I would attend all morning and evening classes.  Doing that would allow me to learn, review and comprehend each lesson even more.  It would be the equivalent to laying down an extra layer of cement on a foundation.  I say that because there are some lessons that are challenging to learn in one sitting without knowing where you might use each technique.  The good news is, once you&#8217;ve learned some basic Javascript (like using for-loops), and are able to implement the function into a web page, you get to have an &#8220;AHA!&#8221; moment.  The last time I felt like that was when I got all the green on the same side of a Rubix-Cube. </p>

       
        <h2 class="topic"><center>Resources</center></h2>
        
        <p class="details">We don&#8217;t just develop the web, sometimes it develops us.  Here are some resources that I found to be useful.  Some of these resources where used to develop my mind set before class began.  I still use all of these resources today, 2 months into the program.  Put it this way, if you don&#8217;t go to a tanning booth before that vacation, you are going to burn your skin.  So prepare your mind and get a decent intro to what you are about to learn.  Not only does it show the teacher you are serious about a career, it is also a good mind set to be self motivated (no one will teach you everything).  CareerDevs is not just a school, it is an established network designed to teach you what you need to know and who you need to know to start your Career.  Otherwise, it would be called ClassDevs.</p>
